What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list;the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith,on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamicconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and timeconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to theinability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of theconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader canarrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs tohappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for theconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not excludebuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for thefuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firmrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a projectplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on tothemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of thisproject.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have beengood.

We've hadthree meetings which brought out very different issues from differenttraders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the traderrequirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear tobe outside the scope of position consolidation.I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal tomake it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with thisproject.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for thisproject and which fall out of scope.For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each andwork with traders to define the exact requirements of each.drill downs.Use the above to formulate a project plan.Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and dealticker.Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns thatadd up existing position manager rows/columns).transport, swaps, options, ...Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time valuesof all curves on which the desk has a position.Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to beshown directly above monthly positions.
